Container networking relies on NAT to allow container network packets
out to the host's network. This requires a PF firewall to perform the
translation. A simple example is included - to use it:

# cp /usr/local/etc/containers/pf.conf.sample /etc/pf.conf
...
Edit /etc/pf.conf and set v4egress_if, v6egress_if to your network interface(s)s
...
# sysrc pf_enable=YES
# service pf start
